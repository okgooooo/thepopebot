# Upgrading

For the standard upgrade process (manual or automated), see [Updating](../README.md#updating) in the README. This document covers **how automated upgrades work** and **how to recover when something goes wrong**.

## How Automated Upgrades Work

Two GitHub Actions workflows handle automated upgrades:

### 1. upgrade-event-handler.yml (manual trigger)

Triggered via `workflow_dispatch` (Actions tab > "Upgrade Event Handler" > Run workflow). This workflow:

1. Clones your repo into a temp directory inside the event handler container
2. Runs `npm install` + `npm update thepopebot`
3. If the version changed, creates an `upgrade/thepopebot-<version>-<timestamp>` branch
4. Opens a PR and enables auto-merge with `--delete-branch`

This workflow only updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. It does **not** run `thepopebot init`, rebuild, or restart anything. That happens when the PR merges.

### 2. rebuild-event-handler.yml (on push to main)

Triggered automatically when the upgrade PR merges to `main`. This workflow detects the version change and:

1. Runs `npx thepopebot init` inside the container to scaffold updated templates
2. Commits any template changes back to `main`
3. Updates `THEPOPEBOT_VERSION` in the server's `.env`
4. Pulls the new Docker image for the event handler
5. Stops the old container and starts a new one
6. Runs `npm install --omit=dev` in the new container
7. Builds `.next` and restarts PM2

If the version didn't change (normal code push), it skips steps 1-5 and does a fast rebuild only (npm install + build + PM2 reload).

## Recovering from a Failed Upgrade

If an automated upgrade fails, SSH into your server and rebuild manually:

```bash
docker exec thepopebot-event-handler npm install --omit=dev
docker exec thepopebot-event-handler bash -c 'rm -rf .next-new .next-old && NEXT_BUILD_DIR=.next-new npm run build && mv .next .next-old 2>/dev/null; mv .next-new .next && rm -rf .next-old'
docker exec thepopebot-event-handler npx pm2 restart all
```

### Merge conflicts on upgrade PR?

If the upgrade PR has merge conflicts in GitHub, resolve them in the GitHub UI or locally:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout upgrade/thepopebot-<version>-<timestamp>
git merge main
# resolve conflicts
git push
```

Once resolved, the PR merges and `rebuild-event-handler.yml` takes over.

### Useful diagnostic commands

```bash
docker ps -a | grep thepopebot-event-handler          # container running?
docker logs thepopebot-event-handler --tail 50         # container logs
docker exec thepopebot-event-handler npx pm2 status    # PM2 status
docker exec thepopebot-event-handler npx pm2 logs --lines 30  # app logs
```
